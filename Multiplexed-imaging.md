# Protocol overview

1. Designing barcodes  
https://www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/oligoanalyzer?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=00583_1a_03&utm_content=search&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi_mZ1tvlgwMVSlxHAR3hhAz_EAAYAyAAEgLEtfD_BwE  

Important properties of barcode  
- not self-complementary (so doesn't fold in on itself)
- not binding to other DNA barcodes
- length (a) enough space to allow enough barcodes and (b) specific to melting point that allows peel off and on (13-20 oligonucleotides long)
- Specificity (scan entire genome to make sure barcodes don't exist)


2. After conjugating DNA oligonucleotide to antibody  
   validate conjugation of barcode with gel electrophoresis
   - antibodies with conjugated barcodes lead to thicker bands ("more" present)
   - unconjugated antibodies lead to thinner bands that travel farther
  
3. Section tissue (cryosectioning and then rehydration)
4. Antigen retrieval
5. Block anitbody stickign you don't have usign buffers
6. Fix antibodies that are already bound
7. Stain tissue and dry the slides manually around the tissue

# Things to thing about for project  
1. what is biological comparison?
2. what do you wan to analyze (Cellular organization, cell-cell interaction,...)
