Important properties of barcode  
- not self-complementary (so doesn't fold in on itself)
- not binding to other DNA barcodes
- length (a) enough space to allow enough barcodes and (b) specific to melting point that allows peel off and on (13-20 oligonucleotides long)
- Specificity (scan entire genome to make sure barcodes don't exist)

Designing barcodes

After conjugating DNA oligonucleotide to antibody
1. validate conjugation of barcode with gel electrophoresis
   - antibodies with conjugated barcodes lead to thicker bands ("more" present)
   - unconjugated antibodies lead to thinner bands that travel farther
